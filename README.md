# FAC Student agreement  

Founders & Coders C.I.C. (FAC)  is a not-for-profit company whose main purpose is to provide study and training programmes for the general public and to provide workspace for its students and graduates.

FAC was founded on the principal of reciprocity. This means that we do not charge our students fees for the full-time course (FACx), but we depend on them contributing to the viability and development of the company in return.

In particular, graduates of each cohort of students are expected to take the lead on facilitating the FACx course for the next cohort, which will ensure that we can continue to offer study programmes and workspace free of charge long into the future. 

From a financial point of view, we rely heavily on recruitment fees from companies who hire our graduates; this is why we also need graduates to give FAC the opportunity to approach employers on their behalf when they are looking for their first jobs as developers.  

Our goal is to be financialy sustainable, and we cannot survive without the continued support of our graduates.

All students must agree to follow these rules as a condition of joining FAC:

+ To help with subsequent full-time courses (FACx) once they have graduated; 
+ To participate in and support the study programmes and meetups that we provide for the general public;
+ To involve FAC if they are considering applying for a position (or encouraging another student to apply);
+ To make all other students and graduates, as well as members of the public, feel welcome in our space.

If you do not follow these rules, you may be asked to leave FAC.

## FAQ

**How much time do I need to give back?**    
If you have just completed one of the FACx full-time study programmes, then it is your collective responsibility with the rest of your cohort to facilitate FACx+1. We also need students to help out with our meetup groups and the study programmes we provide to the general public.  

**What if I don't feel confident running a study programme?**    
Think about what you are most interested in and find someone who would be prepared to work with you to find ways to share your own learning. Think of where your strengths are and make a contribution accordingly.

**What are *"recruitment fees"*? Do they come out of my salary if I get a job through FAC?**    
FAC acts like a recruitment agency in finding work for graduates; employers pay a fee to FAC just as they would to a standard recruitment agency. This fee is the main source of income for FAC and will ensure that we will be able to continue to offer to others the opportunity that graduates of our programme have already benefited from. Recruitment fees are one-off lump sums usually expressed as a percentage of an employee's first year salary, but are paid directly by the employer and do not actually come out of the the employee's salary. 

**What if I receive an unsolicited offer of work?**    
Refer them to us and follow our guidelines on how to communicate with prospective employers. It may be useful to display some explanatory text on your LinkedIn page or other professional platforms - FAC will provide this (but it is not mandatory).

**Won't that stop me getting the job?**    
No. It is often hard, especially with a first job, to realise your own value and it is easy to be over-grateful to a prospective employer who is willing to make you a job offer. Any good employer, once they understand how we operate and the quality of our graduates, is likely to be willing to get involved in a programme that is capable of providing a steady supply of excellent developers. 

**What if I receive a job offer from a friend or ex-employer?**    
Talk to us. In this case, a suggested response might be:  *"I would love to work with you. And if you are looking for any other people, I really recommend you contact the organisation I am part of [insert agreed FAC contact]. I am sure they would be keen to send you more people"*.

**What if I want to apply for a job is in an unrelated field?**    
If the employer is unlikely to hire developers and the job is in a field where recruiters are not usually used, then there is probably no reason to ask them to contact us. If in doubt, ask.

**If I'm freelancing, do I have to give a proportion of my earnings to FAC?**    
FAC finds freelance work for its graduates and takes a proportion as a fee, as any agency would. The amount is decided on a project-by-project basis. You do not need to give a proportion of your earnings to FAC if you have moved away and are finding work for yourself, or if you are earning less than the London Living Wage.   

**If I employ another FAC graduate to work with me, do I have to give a proportion of their earnings to FAC?**    
Like any other employer, you will need to have a recruitment agreement with FAC (although the terms are likely to be more favourable than for other companies).

**Can I run my company from within the FAC workspace and do I have to give a proportion of the earnings to FAC?**   
If you wish to run a company that employs non-FAC staff, then you will need to get agreement from the FAC directors, who must be satisfied that the arrangement is of benefit to FAC. 

**If I am employed elsewhere, does that mean I'm no longer a part of FAC?**    
Not at all. As long as you are prepared to help out, you will always continue to be welcome. Wherever you are, we always want you to help with FAC programmes or to set up events, meetup groups and study programmes under the FAC banner (and jointly with your own company or employer, if you like).

**I am moving abroad. Do I still need to refer prospective employers to FAC?**    
Not unless we have a presence in the city where you work, but do please set up events, meetup groups and study programmes under the FAC banner and keep us posted.

**Will FAC help me find work quickly?**    
FAC will try to support you in your job hunt and mentor you through interviews, but we do not currently have the resources to hire a dedicated recruiter. As we build up a network of partner companies and agency relationships, active recruitment for recent graduates may become less of an issue, but in the short term graduates may have less support than we would like.

**If I tell FAC about a job I want to apply for, will FAC tell other graduates about the job and increase competition for it?**  
We think the fairest thing would be to only advertise this job after a suitable period of time has passed. 

**This rule makes me uneasy. I don't want to involve FAC in my conversations with prospective employers.**    
We understand this, but as our primary source of income, this is currently a condition of joining the programme.

**Are your rules compulsory for all students?**    
We encourage current students to abide by them, but it is now a condition of accepting an offer to study at FAC.
