# Proposed members' charter

Founders & Coders C.I.C. (FAC)  is a not-for-profit company whose main purpose is to provide study and training programmes for the general public and to provide workspace for its members.

FAC was founded on the principal of reciprocity. That is, the company does not charge fees for its study programmes, but expects its members to contribute according to their abilities to the viability and development of the company.

In particular, members are expected to participate in our study programmes and to support our goal of being financially sustainable, which will ensure that we can continue to offer study programmes and workspace free of charge long into the future.

All members must abide by the following rules of membership.

+ To support new members in their studies (and primarily to help with the full-time study programme); 
+ To participate in and support the study programmes that we provide to the general public;
+ When considering an application for a position (whether permanent or contract) at a company with which FAC does not have an agency relationship, first give FAC the opportunity to establish contact with the employer for the purposes of initiating an agency relationship;
+ When considering encouraging another member to apply for a position (whether permanent or contract) at a company with which FAC does not have an agency relationship, first give FAC the opportunity to establish contact with the employer for the purposes of initiating an agency relationship;
+ To make all other members, as well as members of the public, feel welcome in our space.

None of these rules will apply retrospectively.

Any member may terminate their membership at any time. Failure to abide by these rules may lead to withdrawal of membership.

## FAQ

**How much time do I need to give back each month?**    
As a minimum, regardless of where you are based, you need to be active in at least one FAC study programme or meetup group.  If you are not working full-time on a project from which FAC is benefiting financially and you are using FAC workspace for your own learning or work, then a minimum of 20 hours per month is expected. If you have just completed one of the FACx programmes, then it is your collective responsibility with the rest of your cohort to facilitate FACx+1.

**What if I do not feel confident being a mentor or running a study programme?**    
Think about what you are most interested in and find another member who would be prepared to work with you to find ways to share your own learning. Think of where your strengths are and make a contribution accordingly.

**What is meant by an *agency relationship*?**    
An agreement whereby FAC receives a fee from the employer. This fee is the main source of income for FAC and will ensure that we will be able to continue to offer the opportunities to others that our members have already benefited from.

**What if I receive an unsolicited offer of work?**    
Refer them to us and follow our guidelines on how to communicate with prospective employers. [in preparation, but likely to include a recommendation that all members put a note on their linkedin profiles that refers prospective employers to FAC]

**Won't that stop me getting the job?**    
No. It is often hard, especially with a first job, to realise your own value and it is easy to be over-grateful to a prospective employer who is willing to make you a job offer. Any good employer, once they understand how we operate and the quality of our members is likely to be willing to get involved in a programme that is capable of  providing a steady supply of excellent developers. 

**What if I receive a job offer from a friend or ex-employer?**    
Talk to us. In this case, a suggested response might be:  "I would love to work with you. And if you are looking for any other people, I really recommend you contact the organisation I am a member of [insert agreed FAC contact]. I am sure they would be keen to send you more people."

**What if I want to apply for a job is in an unrelated field?**    
If the employer is unlikely to hire developers and the job is in a field where recruiters are not usually used, then there is probably no reason to ask them to contact us. If in doubt, ask.

**If I am freelancing, do I have to give a proportion of my earnings to FAC?**    
Not unless the work came through FAC [?], in which case the proportion returned to FAC will be decided on a project-by-project basis.

**If I employ another FAC member to work with me, do I have to give a proportion of their earnings to FAC?**    
Like any other employer, you will need to have an agency agreement with FAC (although the terms are likely to be more favourable than for other companies).

**Can I run my company from within the FAC workspace and do I have to give a proportion of the earnings to FAC?**    
If you wish to run a company that employs non-FAC staff, then you will need to get agreement from the membership, which must be satisfied that the arrangement is of benefit to FAC. 

**I am now employed elsewhere. Do I have to give up my membership?**    
Not at all. As long as you are prepared to abide by our membership rules, you will always continue to be welcome as a member. Wherever you are, we will expect you to help with FAC programmes or to set up events, meetup groups and study programmes under the FAC banner (and jointly with your own company or employer, where appropriate).

**I live and work abroad. Do I still need to refer prospective employers to FAC?**    
Not unless we have a presence in the city where you work, but do please set up events, meetup groups and study programmes under the FAC banner and keep us posted.

**Will FAC help me find work?**    
FAC will support you in your job hunt and mentor you through interviews, but we do not currently have the resources to hire a dedicated recruiter, so in the short-term members will need to act as their own recruiters, but when resources allow, then we may well employ somebody. Also, as we build up a network of partner companies and agency relationships, active recruitment for recent graduates may become less of an issue.

**This makes me uneasy. I don't want to involve FAC in my conversations with prospective employers.**    
We understand this. FAC membership may not be the right choice for you.

**Is FAC membership compulsory for all students?**    
It will be from 2016 onwards.
