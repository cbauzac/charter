# FAC Student agreement  

Founders & Coders C.I.C. (FAC) is a not-for-profit company whose main purpose is to provide study and training programmes for the general public and to provide workspace for its students and graduates.

FAC was founded on the principal of reciprocity. This means that we do not charge our students fees for the full-time programme, but we depend on them contributing to the viability and development of the company in return.

In particular, graduates of each cohort of students are expected collectively to take the lead on facilitating the programme for the next student cohort. 

From a financial point of view, each place on the Founders & Coders programme costs us about Â£2,500 to provide. To recover this cost, we rely heavily on the fees we receive from companies who employ our graduates. 

If, for whatever reason, you find employment without our assistance, we ask you to consider making a regular voluntary contribution as a way of *'paying it forward'* to provide a place on the course for someone on the next cohort.
